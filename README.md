# "Rascals" (Game)

A CLI-based game written in Phython and inspired by [Dani Bunten Berry's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Bunten_Berry) classic '[Robot Rascals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Rascals)'. Writing this game helped me learn Python and object-oriented programming. It was written for the son of a friend, both of whom are too young to have ever played [Robot Rascals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Rascals).
