# "Retro Rascals" (Game)

A Terminal-based game written in Phython and inspired by [Dani Bunten Berry's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danielle_Bunten_Berry) classic '[Robot Rascals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Rascals)'. Originally written for the son of a friend (both of whom too young to remember [Robot Rascals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Rascals)), it was one of my earlier attempts to teach myself object-oriented programming.
